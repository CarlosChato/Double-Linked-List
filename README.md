# Double-Linked-List

Sometimes in data structures is more efficent dont use an array, and use other type of data structure. In this case we have a Double Linked List. For understand in wich cases is more efficent than the array, we need know how work the array in memory and how work the Double Linked List.

Basically, the array work like a consecutive datas saves in memory, and it get the data with a formula. In much cases is a good form to save datas, but sometimes is not efficent, for example if we have a lot of datas and we wont add or delete it, use an array is a good choice. But the problem is if we will do a lot of changes like add or remove a data, in that case is more efficent use a Double linked List or a Single Linked List.
Its happen, because when the array have a lot of changes, it will search an other memory space to save the array, and it could a lot of time, in time complexity. But make changes in the Double Linked List could have a more efficent time complexity, because the it works with memory jumps, it isn't save in a consecutive form.
