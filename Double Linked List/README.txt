A Double linked list is more efficent than the single linked list, because we have
two references at the node, with this we can have a better time complexity in some
methods, for example in addLast, where is not necessary go for all the list with an 
aux node.

So if you want use a linked list i think you should use the double linked list, in 
this code you have all the methods that have the python's array, except some methods
like sort, because i think it is not necessary, you can sort the list, depending 
the node's element.
