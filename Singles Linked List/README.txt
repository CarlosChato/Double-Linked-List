The Single Linked List, is a worst option than de Double Linked List, but in some case
it has the same time complexity. If you want use a linked list, you should
use a Double linked List.

Here you have the code of the Single Linked List, with all the methods that 
have a python's array, so you can use it like an array. Except for some methods
that i think it is not neecessary in a linked list, for example the sort method, 
because in the linked list you should order the list denpending of the 
node's element.
